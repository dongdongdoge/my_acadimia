Hello guys, this is Wentao DONG, a former software engineer, a current PhD student, a semi-basketball enthusiast, a 53.618% ukulele lover, **a nobody who wants to be somebody**.  

I am interested in _Privacy Enhancement Technologies_, _Artificial Intelligence_, _Encrypted Database_, _Blockchain_, as well as _Financial Portfolio_, _Precision Medicine_, and any other scenario where privacy-preserving computation can be brought to our day-to-day life (applicable & practical), if it is also your cup of tea, please contact me via [here](mailto:dongdongdoge@gmail.com).

_Talk is cheap, so I am trying to get something done._
